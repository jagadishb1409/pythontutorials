# Working with Lists in Python

Lists are an essential data structure in Python, used to store collections of items. 
They are flexible, dynamic, and can hold items of different types. 
In this blog, we will delve into the details of working with lists in Python, including creating, accessing, modifying, and sorting lists.

## Creating Lists

In Python, a list is created by enclosing elements separated by commas within square brackets []. 
For example, the following code creates a list of numbers:

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
````

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Lists can also contain elements of different types:

````python
mixed = [1, "two", 3.0, [4, 5]]
print(mixed)
````

Output: [1, "two", 3.0, [4, 5]]

You can also create a list with a range of numbers using the range function:

````python
numbers = list(range(10))
print(numbers)
````

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## Accessing List Elements
Once you have created a list, you can access its elements by using an index. 
The index of the first element is 0, and the index of the last element is len(list) - 1.

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[0]) # 1
print(numbers[4]) # 5
````

You can also access elements from the end of the list using negative indices. 
For example, -1 is the index of the last element, -2 is the index of the second last element, and so on.

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[-1]) # 5
print(numbers[-2]) # 4
````

## Modifying List Elements
You can modify the elements of a list by assigning new values to them using their indices.

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers[0] = 10
print(numbers)
````

Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Adding and Removing List Elements
You can add elements to a list using the append method. The append method adds the element to the end of the list.

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)
````

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

You can insert an element at a specific position using the insert method. 
The insert method takes two arguments: the index at which to insert the element and the element itself.

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.insert(0, 0)
print(numbers)
````
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


You can also remove elements from a list using the remove method. 
The remove method removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list.

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.remove(3)
print(numbers)
````

Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]

If you want to remove an element at a specific index, you can use the pop method. 
The pop method removes the element at the specified index and returns its value.

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.pop(2))
print(numbers)
````

Output:
3
[1, 2, 4, 5]

## Sorting Lists
You can sort the elements of a list in ascending or descending order using the sort method. By default, the sort method sorts the elements in ascending order.

````python
numbers = [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
````
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

You can sort the elements in descending order by passing the argument reverse=True to the sort method.

````python
numbers = [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)
````
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

## The 'In' and 'not in' Operators

The 'in' and 'not in' operators are used to test for membership in Python.
The 'in' operator returns True if a specified value is found within an object (e.g. list, tuple, set, etc.), and False otherwise. For example:


````python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in list) # True
print(6 in list) # False
````

The 'not in' operator returns True if a specified value is not found within an object, and False otherwise. For example:

````python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 not in list) # False
print(6 not in list) # True
````

These operators can also be used with strings to check if a substring is present in a string or not. For example:

````python
string = "Hello, World!"
print("Hello" in string) # True
print("hello" in string) # False
print("hello" not in string) # True
````

## Finding index of an element using index()

The 'index()' method in Python can be used to find the index of an element in a list. 
It returns the first index at which the specified value is found. If the specified value is not found in the list, it raises a 'ValueError' exception.

Here's an example of using the 'index()' method to find the index of an element in a list:

````python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list.index(3) # 2
````

In the above example, the 'index()' method returns the index of the first occurrence of the value 3 in the list, which is 2.

If you want to find the index of an element in a list that may have multiple occurrences of the same value, you can use a for loop and the 'enumerate()' function. The 'enumerate()' function takes an iterable object as input and returns an iterator that yields pairs of the form '(index, value)' for each element in the iterable. Here's an example:

````python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6]
for i, value in enumerate(list):
     if value == 3:
         print(i)
# 2
# 5
````

In this example, the for loop iterates over the elements of the list and uses the 'enumerate()' function to get both the index and value of each element. The 'if' statement inside the loop checks if the current value is equal to '3', and if so, it prints the index. This will find all occurrences of the value '3' in the list.

## Math Operations on Lists in Python

### Addition

Lists can be added together using the + operator. This creates a new list that is the concatenation of the two input lists. For example:

````python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = list1 + list2
print(result) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
````

### Multiplication

Lists can be multiplied by an integer using the * operator. This creates a new list that repeats the original list the specified number of times. For example:

````python
list = [1, 2, 3]
result = list * 3
print(result) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
````

### Sum

The sum function can be used to find the sum of the elements of a list. The list must contain only numbers for this to work. For example:

````python
list = [1, 2, 3]
result = sum(list)
print(result) # Output: 6
````

### Average

The average of the elements of a list can be found by dividing the sum of the elements by the number of elements. For example:

````python
list = [1, 2, 3]
result = sum(list) / len(list)
print(result) # Output: 2.0
````

### Maximum and Minimum

The maximum and minimum values in a list can be found using the max and min functions respectively. For example:

````python
list = [1, 2, 3]
maximum = max(list)
minimum = min(list)
print(maximum) # Output: 3
print(minimum) # Output: 1
````
