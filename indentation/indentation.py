# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

#example:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# here you can see I have used : instead of {} how it is used in other languages
# once condition for loops is given we start writing with four space or tab space
# please read PEP guidlines mentioned in the indentation.md
